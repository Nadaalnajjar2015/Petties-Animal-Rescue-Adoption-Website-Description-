          <h2>My Story</h2>

          <p>
            One day, in the backyard of our house, a cat gave birth to two
            kittens. The mother cat took one of them and, sadly, left the other
            behind. The little kitten kept meowing all night long. The next
            morning, I saw her still alone, and since the mother didn’t come
            back, I decided to take her in. I bought special milk for kittens,
            cleaned her gently, and took care of her with great care and love. I
            also took her to the vet, who gave me some advice on how to raise a
            newborn kitten without a mother. For five days, I stayed by her
            side, feeding her, watching over her, and hoping she would grow
            stronger. But on the fifth day, she suddenly stopped drinking milk.
            No matter how hard I tried, she wouldn’t feed. By dawn, her energy
            was gone, and she looked very weak. I was terrified and rushed her
            to the clinic while crying, heartbroken and scared for her life. The
            vet told me that her chances of survival were very slim, but gave
            her some vitamins and pain relief. Unfortunately, just half an hour
            after we got home, she passed away. I was deeply saddened by her
            loss, and after that experience, I grew even more attached to
            animals. So when I was asked to come up with an idea for a
            university project, this memory came back to me — and I thought: Why
            not create a website that helps animals and pet owners? And that’s
            how the idea for our project was born. 🐾 ❤️
